    - improved find() documentation
    - fixed cpanfile min perl version
    - modified tests to use the expression form of eval to try to load Web::Query::LibXML

      (cafe01)
      
0.22 2013-05-15T23:36:38Z

    - added new module: Web::Query::LibXML
    - modified test files to also test Web::Query::LibXML (if it loads).

0.21 2013-05-15T14:36:11Z

    - new jQuery-compatible method: add()
    - fixed filter() that relied on wrong find() behavior
    - fixed two t/03_traverse.t tests that was expecting wrong behavior from filter()    

0.20 2013-05-13T22:51:02Z

    - improved documentation
    - fixed find() to match only descendant elements
      This is the correct jQuery compatible implementation, which I have changed in 0.14 to also match root nodes, my bad.
    - fixed tests that relied on that wrong find() behavior.
      (cafe01)

0.19 2013-05-12T18:19:57Z

    - implemented contents() jQuery-compatible method
    - new() now accepts another Web::Query object
      (cafe01)      

0.18 2013-05-09T19:40:40Z

    - fixed html() method, now using $self->_build_tree
    - calling parent() instead of undocumented getParentNode()
    - calling disembowel() instead of guts()
      Need for Web::Query::LibXML, so nodes get detached from old document and returned each as root of a new document.
      (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)
      

0.17 2013-05-08T01:18:36Z

    - new_from_file() now calling guts() instead of elementify()
      So the file can contain a document fragment (multiple root nodes) instead of a full document (single root).
      Also, now all new_from_* methods behave the same.
      (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)

0.16 2013-04-22T14:26:44Z

    - modified new_from_element() to ignore non-blessed items
      (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)
    - created _build_tree() method
      (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)


0.15 2013-04-09T00:29:48Z

    - added clone() method
      (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)
    - now storing comments from parsed html
      (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)
    - fixed remove() to get rid of removed element refs
      removes from $self and from all $self->{before}.
      Also modified how each() instantiates the objects, so $_->end works in the callback, which is needed for $_->remove() to work in the callback.
      (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)
