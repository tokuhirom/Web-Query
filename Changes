    (Reported by @daxim++, Fixed by @yanick++)

0.23 2013-05-30T16:09:03Z
  - improved find() documentation
  - fixed cpanfile min perl version
  - modified tests to use the expression form of eval to try to load
    Web::Query::LibXML - the block form of eval is not working as expected
    on some perl versions on i386-freebsd (cafe01)

0.22 2013-05-15T23:36:38Z
  - added new module: Web::Query::LibXML
  - modified test files to also test Web::Query::LibXML (if it loads).

0.21 2013-05-15T14:36:11Z
  - new jQuery-compatible method: add()
  - fixed filter() that relied on wrong find() behavior
  - fixed two t/03_traverse.t tests that was expecting wrong behavior from
    filter() 

0.20 2013-05-13T22:51:02Z
  - improved documentation
  - fixed find() to match only descendant elements This is the correct
    jQuery compatible implementation, which I have changed in 0.14 to also
    match root nodes, my bad.
  - fixed tests that relied on that wrong find() behavior. (cafe01)

0.19 2013-05-12T18:19:57Z
  - implemented contents() jQuery-compatible method
  - new() now accepts another Web::Query object (cafe01)      

0.18 2013-05-09T19:40:40Z
  - fixed html() method, now using $self->_build_tree
  - calling parent() instead of undocumented getParentNode()
  - calling disembowel() instead of guts() Need for Web::Query::LibXML, so
    nodes get detached from old document and returned each as root of a new
    document. (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)

0.17 2013-05-08T01:18:36Z
  - new_from_file() now calling guts() instead of elementify() So the file
    can contain a document fragment (multiple root nodes) instead of a full
    document (single root). Also, now all new_from_* methods behave the
    same. (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)

0.16 2013-04-22T14:26:44Z
  - modified new_from_element() to ignore non-blessed items (Carlos
    Fernando Avila Gratz)
  - created _build_tree() method (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)

0.15 2013-04-09T00:29:48Z
  - added clone() method (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)
  - now storing comments from parsed html (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)
  - fixed remove() to get rid of removed element refs removes from $self
    and from all $self->{before}. Also modified how each() instantiates the
    objects, so $_->end works in the callback, which is needed for
    $_->remove() to work in the callback. (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)

0.14 2013-04-07T02:22:25Z
  - new jQuery compatible methods, and related tests * append * prepend *
    before * after * insert_before * insert_after * detach * add_class *
    remove_class * has_class (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)

0.13 2013-04-05T06:37:27Z
  - fixed find() bug was calling selector_to_xpath() in the loop, breaking
    the selector after the second call. (Carlos Fernando Avila Gratz)
  - Search from '//' when the node was created from HTML. (tokuhirom)

0.12 2013-04-03T20:24:49Z
